# Goals for today

* Understand what the rmarkdown package is and what you can build with it
* Learn the basics of a RMD document so you can use it to do analysis and/or build reproducible reports
* Transform your RMD report into a paramaterized report
* Learn how you can leverage RStudio Connect to publish your RMD reports to communicate your findings and reach more people


# What can I build with the rmarkdown package? 

- Static reports in various formats including [html](http://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/content/1129/report.html){target="_blank"}, [PDF](https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/content/2612/2019-report.pdf){target="_blank"}, Word, and Powerpoint. 
- Websites. The [rmarkdown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} itself is built using rmarkdown
- [Presentations](http://svmiller.com/rmarkdown-example.pdf){target="_blank"} (ioslides, Slidy, Beamer, Powerpoint, reveal.js, xaringan)
- [Interactive dashboards](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/cran-gauge/){target="_blank"}
- [Books](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/books.html){target="_blank"}
- [Tutorials](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/){target="_blank"}
- [See the R Markdown gallery](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html){target="_blank"}


# How it works
 
When you run render, R Markdown feeds the .Rmd file to knitr, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and itâ€™s output.

The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by pandoc which is responsible for creating the finished format.

This may sound complicated, but R Markdown makes it extremely simple by encapsulating all of the above processing into a single  render function.

# Housekeeping 

Install some packages we'll be using today: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

# Summary 

* Use RMD to create reproducible reports and other data artifacts 
* Add parameters to your report to rerun your report under different set of assumptions
* Automate the execution and delivery of your reports with the Connect scheduler
* Craft custom email notifications
